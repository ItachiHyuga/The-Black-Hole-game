# The Black Hole

A submission for js13kGames.


 A short game built on Ga engine for Js13kGames JavaScript coding competition. 
-----------------------------

## GAME DESCRIPTION

### ABOUT
 To cross a level you need to devour all the planets. Devouring a planet increases your size. If you touch the edges, the level ends. 

### CONTROLS
 Arrow Keys: Move
 P: Pause/Resume 
 Space: Next level
 
### LEVELS
 There are 18 levels in the game with increasing difficulty. The number of planets that you have to eat and the speed also goes up by 1 per level. 

### SCORE
 You get score per planet you eat. The more difficult the level, the more the planet is worth. For instance, level 2 planet gives you a score of +2, while a level 16 planet gives you +16.
 Once you hit a wall, certain score is deducted regardless of the level, as a price to replay that level. If the score ever hits zero, the game restarts from level 1.

### SPECIAL THANKS
 I would not have worked on this game was it not for Anya. Many thanks to her for the various, suggestions and consistent grinding of the game which inevitably became the motivation for finishing the challenge.
 Many thanks to Sid and Mahesh for testing out various levels and their recommendations to improve it.
 I am novice at game development, and this is one of the first games I've made, and Ga engine is the first game engines that I have worked on. The documentation on it is insanely well written and really helped me understand how javascript game development goes. Even the code is well commented and seggmented making it easier to edit it for this challenge. I absolutely enjoyed using it and learned a lot along the way.

 The sounds I have taken from https://xem.github.io/MiniSoundEditor/ with some minor changes of my own.

### INTRODUCTION
I am just a beginner at this, so most of my code might not be the shortest or the most efficient. But I have made an effort to make it readable and comments become a basic part of that. 
Some of the variables are not named well, because I was looking to cut size, but that is completely my fault as I realised I should have just done that at a later stage of the game when everything was done and dusted and all I had to do was minify the game. It would have been a better idea to keep long descriptive variable names and just replacing them later with alphabets or characters.
